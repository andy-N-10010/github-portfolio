# github-portfolio
This is my portfolio website. This is where I host my must-see projects that I did as well as my new projects. You can check it out here: https://andy-n-10010.github.io/github-portfolio/. These projects were my favorites. They each demonstrated my care and attention to detail that I put into. I have learned so much over the years, and I'm happy to express it through these projects. I will continue to upload projects and grow my understanding in software as it's applied to problems and opportunities within our society.
