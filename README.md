# github-portfolio
This is my portfolio website. This is where I host my must-see projects that I did as well as my new projects. You can check it out here: https://andy-n-10010.github.io/github-portfolio/. These projects were my favorites. They each demonstrated my care and attention to detail that I put into. I have learned so much over the years, and I'm happy to express it through these projects. I will continue to upload projects and grow my understanding in software as it's applied to problems and opportunities within our society.

The following information is about my personal portfolio website!

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
These challenges are what I encountered while building the website.

# Learning React / Typescript / EsLint / Vite
I wanted to challenge myself in building a modern-day web application that a typical full-stack developer encounters. I wanted a project that used the same tools as other applications, such as Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, etc. And I learned all about why they used these tools as I directly applied them. React is able to use state and component development in order to give an application so much more functionality. TypeScript allows for the construction of types and variables to enhance JavaScript. ESLint allows for production-ready code that can keep the developer from making ambiguous mistakes. Finally, with Vite, I was able to build my application at a very efficient pace. I learned that for this big tech stack, you would need to compile and build it to get an executable that handles all of the different libraries. I learned how to build production-ready code that can be expanded upon to grow my web app in an engaging way for the audience. I still have plenty to learn about everything. For example, I recently learned all about the return statements within React and how they are trees of data.

# Learning Node.js
Node.js is an essential library for the functionality of the tech stack. I learned about its purpose and installation. Without it, it won't even run. This environment allows the javascript to run. It provides command-line tools and scripts that make it easy for the developer to get up and running.

# Component development
With React, I had to shift my mind away from the typical HTML/CSS/JavaScript mindset and focus solely on components. With components, it makes it easier to maintain everything because everything can be categorized and organized based on its part. So I would make a component, and its corresponding style sheet CSS. This allows for reusability and testability. I would build a component, such as the carousel component, and be able to place it anywhere I want. 

# Structure of an active production
I had the challenge of building a production-ready application. This meant that I had to figure out the workflow of a typical developer for this application. Specifically, how components would fit together and how and why each part was sectioned off the way it was. I learned about the typical structure of a front-end application that is typically made. Components would be made, then added to the app.tsx which is another component that builds the component together to be put on the HTML. Everything was very easy to build and expand upon because the project followed encapsulation. The facade pattern hid away the complexities of the project with just the HTML. And if I wanted to customize, I could with the app.tsx being the builder pattern and factory pattern as well. I was able to customize my page in any way by switching around the components made. And then the factory would produce the JavaScript work and pass it along to the HTML. This all became easy to maintain. 

# No structs like in C, but interfaces instead
I was stuck on building the data structure to plug into my carousel component for a little bit. TypeScript isn't a language that supports structs. I learned more about interfaces because that was my solution in building a data structure. I applied two interfaces that each had their own properties and used a union and held it as a structure to be passed into the carousel component. That's how the component could then decide if the input was an image or a video. And this allowed for carousels to show video as well as images. This allowed more flexibility and added functionality to my page.


## How this was built
This was made using React, Typescript, Node.js, and EsLint.
